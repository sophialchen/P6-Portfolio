            <p> My name is Sophia Chen and I am a senior studying Computer Science at Northwestern University.
              Something interesting about me is that I actually switched into the computer science major
              right before starting my senior year. I had always felt like there was something missing in my previous majors, and
              after taking a few computer science courses, I found out it is something I really enjoy.
            I like how computer science is not only logically challenging, but also has a lot of room to be innovative and
          express yourself creatively. </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy circus fitness and doting on my dog, Petey. <p>
